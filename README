Package %{scl_name} provides packages required for running usmqe integration
tests delivered as a Dependent Software Collection of rh-python35. For more
information about Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'bash'

The usmqe server is machine where usmqe integration tests are installed and
executed.

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.
